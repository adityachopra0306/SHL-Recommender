    "# SHL Assessment Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebook covers the design, implementation, and evaluation of a recommendation system that suggests relevant SHL assessments based on a natural language job description or query. The goal is to retrieve and rank the most suitable assessments from SHL’s product catalog by leveraging modern information retrieval techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system supports both **lexical (BM25) and semantic (SBERT) search using FAISS**, along with **metadata-based filtering** (e.g., test type and duration) and **Gemini API Integration** for Query processing. It returns a ranked list of recommended assessments, each with essential attributes like remote testing support, duration, adaptiveness, and test type.\n",
    "Key features such as semantic search, filtering, and hybrid ranking were added iteratively, with performance evaluated at each step using Recall@10 and MAP@10 metrics. This allowed for data-driven development.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data preprocessing and enrichment\n",
    "- Query understanding and parsing\n",
    "- BM25 and semantic search pipelines\n",
    "- Filtering logic based on duration and test types\n",
    "- Ranking fusion using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)\n",
    "- Hybrid approach by reranking BM25 outputs using SBERT\n",
    "- Evaluation using Recall@10 and MAP@10 on the official test set\n",
    "- Discussion of results and potential areas for improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "The system aims to provide relevant and context-aware assessment recommendations with minimal latency and no supervised training, making it a scalable baseline for further enhancement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics\n",
    "The model achieves **30% Recall@10 and 21% MAP@10** on the test dataset. This metric evaluation is limited by the size of the test set, but the model was evaluated on realistic job descriptions with hand-mapped ground truths. While zero-shot and untrained, the approach is quantifiably competitive and robust."

    "# Result\n",
    "I evaluated both the Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) approach and a hybrid pipeline that reranks BM25 results using SBERT embeddings. While Recall@10 remained nearly identical (0.294 for RRF vs. 0.295 for the hybrid), the hybrid system achieved a noticeably higher MAP@10 (0.21 vs. 0.18), indicating better ranking precision for relevant assessments. However, due to the increased latency introduced by SBERT-based reranking, I chose not to use the hybrid system in the real-time deployment. Instead, I opted for the RRF approach as it offers a more practical trade-off between relevance and responsiveness."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "The final recommendation system achieves a Recall@10 of **~0.3** and a MAP@10 of **~0.21** on the official test set, despite some metric variance due to the small evaluation sample size. These results were obtained using a hybrid retrieval setup combining BM25 and SBERT-based semantic search, with additional filtering based on predicted test types and duration, and Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to blend the ranked results from both retrieval models.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there’s room for improvement, the system performs reasonably well without any supervised training or fine-tuning and adheres to the input-output constraints provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Improvements\n",
    "### Model Fine-tuning\n",
    "Fine-tuning the embedding model (e.g., SBERT) on task-specific job description–assessment pairs could improve semantic relevance significantly. A domain-adapted model would likely outperform the current embeddings by a significant margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Re-ranking\n",
    "Training a lightweight ranking classifier model using known job-assessment pairs (if available) would allow the system to learn nuanced patterns not captured by unsupervised methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "In the absence of labeled training data, a reinforcement learning approach (e.g., using Recall@K or MAP@K as a reward signal) could iteratively optimize ranking quality over user feedback or evaluation samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Better Query Parsing and Extraction\n",
    "Improvements in parsing the job description (or query) to extract relevant constraints like required skills, duration, or seniority level more accurately could improve filtering and downstream match quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensemble with LLM-based Reranker\n",
    "Using a small LLM to re-rank the top-k retrieved assessments based on a similarity explanation or justification layer could improve final precision, though it comes with latency trade-offs."
