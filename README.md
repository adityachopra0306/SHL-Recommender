# SHL Assessment Recommender System

This project implements an intelligent recommendation system that suggests the most relevant SHL assessments based on a natural language job description or hiring requirement. It combines modern Information Retrieval (IR) techniquesâ€”including semantic embeddings, BM25 lexical search, and metadata-based filteringâ€”into a hybrid pipeline. The goal is to retrieve and rank SHL assessments in a context-aware, efficient, and scalable manner.
This achieves an **Recall@10 of 0.3, and an MAP@10 of 0.2**, which is competitive given the zero-shot pre-trained model.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Retrieval Pipeline:** Combines BM25 (lexical) and SBERT (semantic) search.
- **RAG-Augmented Processing:** Integrates Google Gemini API for advanced query parsing.
- **FAISS Indexing:** Fast similarity search using dense vector embeddings.
- **Metadata Filtering:** Based on test type, adaptiveness, and duration.
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF):** Fuses scores from multiple retrieval pipelines.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Supports Recall@10 and MAP@10 for model evaluation.
- **Web Application:** Accessible via FastAPI (backend) and Streamlit (frontend).

## Evaluation

The system was evaluated on SHL's provided test set:

- **Recall@10:** 0.30
- **MAP@10:** 0.21

These results were achieved without any supervised training. Future improvements could involve classifier ensembling or reranking using domain-specific fine-tuning.

## Data Processing

- Assessments scraped from: [SHL Product Catalog](https://www.shl.com/solutions/products/product-catalog/)
- Extracted Fields:
  - `data-entity-id`
  - `Assessment Name`
  - `Relative URL`
  - `Remote Testing Support`
  - `Adaptive/IRT Support`
  - `Test Type`
  - `Assessment Length/Duration`

- Data was cleaned, deduplicated, enriched with additional metadata, and stored as CSV. Within a kaggle environment, it was then cleaned and processed and the resulting dataframe saved in `/scripts/df_clean.pkl`.

---

## Embedding & Indexing

- Sentence embeddings generated using **SBERT** (`all-mpnet-base-v2`).
- Dense vector index created using **FAISS** for semantic similarity.
- Gemini used to process queries and extract key constraints (e.g., duration, test type).
- Metadata filtering applied after retrieval.

## API Endpoints

The backend can be accessed through the base url: [https://adityachopra0306-shl-recommender.hf.space/](https://adityachopra0306-shl-recommender.hf.space/). HuggingFace Space has been used for hosting.

The backend is served via FastAPI with the following endpoints:

- `GET /health`: Health check endpoint
- `POST /recommend`: Lightweight query â†’ top assessments (used for API, curls)
- `POST /recommend_full`: Query parsing + retrieval + filtering (used by frontend)

### Example Request

```http
POST /recommend
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "I need a 30 to 40 minute test to evaluate .NET Framework skills for remote hiring."
}
```

```cmd
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"query\":\"I need a 30 to 40 minute test to evaluate .NET Framework skills for remote hiring.\"}" https://adityachopra0306-shl-recommender.hf.space/recommend
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "recommended_assessments": [
    {
      "url": "https://www.shl.com/products/product-catalog/view/net-framework-4-5/",
      "adaptive_support": "yes",
      "description": "The.NET Framework 4.5 test measures knowledge of .NET environment. Designed for experienced users, this test covers the following topics: Application Development, Application Foundation, Data Modeling, Deployment, Diagnostics, Performance, Portability, and Security.",
      "duration": 30,
      "remote_support": "yes",
      "test_type": ["Knowledge & Skills"],
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Web Application

A responsive frontend is built with **Streamlit** and connects to the FastAPI backend. Users can input natural language queries and receive real-time recommendations with detailed assessment metadata.

---

## Evaluation Pipeline

Evaluation was performed using:

- Official test set with job descriptions and expected assessments.
- Metrics:
  - **Recall@10**
  - **MAP@10**

No supervised learning was usedâ€”making this model robust, scalable, and zero-shot compatible.

---

## Known Limitations

- Semantic matching struggles on abstract or managerial queries.
- Latency increases with Gemini calls (can be mitigated via caching or offline pre-parsing).
- No personalization or adaptive reranking (future scope).

---

## Future Work

- Fine-tune embeddings or train a classifier for domain adaptation.
- Add caching and rate-limiting for Gemini API.
- Incorporate user feedback loop for online learning.
- Explore integration with resume parsers and ATS systems.
